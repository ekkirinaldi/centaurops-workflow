The following pages provide information about how to develop and configure CentaurOps applications.

The [Develop an application in CentaurOps](/develop-application) guide walks you through packaging and serving a flow, from your local development environment to a containerized application.

* [Memory and Storage](/memory) - Configure CentaurOps's storage and caching behavior.

* [Session Management](/session-id) - Use session ID to manage communication between components.

* [Logging](/logging) - Monitor and debug your CentaurOps applications.

* [Webhook](/webhook) - Trigger your flows with external requests.
